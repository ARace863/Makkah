    <h1>Fateh Makkah</h1>
    <div class="statement">
      <h2>Fateh makkah took place in 630 AD (8 years after hijrah). It can be translated to the
        muslim conquest of Makkah. The prophet SAW gathered 10,000 men after seeing a vision
        from Allah SWT in which he (SAW) was doing Hajj.
        The reason for Fateh Makkah was that the Prophet Muhammad SAW wanted to put an end to the injustice
        and oppression which occurred to the ummah surrounding the prophet and other Muslims in the area.
        It was a peaceful venture to Makkah al Mukarramah in order to take it back from the Quraysh and
        allow muslims to do Umrah or Hajj. It also marked the end of the wars between the Muslims and the Quraysh.

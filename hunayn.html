    <h1>The Battle of Hunayn</h1>
    <div class="statement">
      <h2>The battle of Hunayn was a battle which took place in 628 AD. It was fought
        between the bedouins of the Hawazin and the muslims led by prophet Muhamad
        SAW. It was fought as the tribe of Hawazin had heard about the conquest of
        makkah. They also disliked the fact that islam could spread further through
        Arabia. To stop this, they made an allyship with a tribe from Taif called
        Thaqif. When the prophet heard about the news, he prepared an army of 12,000
        soldiers. Over 10k of these soldiers also took part in the conquest of makkah.
        Lastly, 2,000 soldiers embraced islam and left the Quraysh. In the end,
        81 muslim soldiers had died as martyrs.

    <h1>Evidence and Conclusion</h1>
    <div class="statement">
      <h2>Surat At-Tawbah verse 29: Fight those who do not believe in Allah
        and the Last Day, nor comply with what Allah and His Messenger have
        forbidden, nor embrace the religion of truth from among those who
        were given the Scripture, until they pay the tax, willingly
        submitting, fully humbled.
      </h2>

      <h2>This verse is referencing the fact that some of the
        muslim soldiers were running away from the battlefield
        due to their fear (which they overcame later). It was
        only revealed a few years after the battle of Hunain.
        This is a message to the people who fled the battle
        and to all people after them. It is a message which
        states to only fear Allah SWT. The treaty of
        hudaybiyyah was signed 2 years before the battle of hunayn (628-630 AD).</h2>

      <h2>From this I learnt that you shouldn't run away from things
        and you should face them as you should fear things except for
        Allah. An example for the battle of hunayn is that if Allah has
        prescribed for you to die, you will die. It is all part of
        his divine decree. If you are unsure about something, just do
        istikhara as only Allah can change your decree for the better.</h2>
